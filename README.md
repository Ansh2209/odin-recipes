# The Odin Project - Recipes Website

This is a TOP project where I make a simple website for some cooking recipes.
It is to demonstrate basic html skills like lists, images, links etc

The website is hosted via Github and can be accessed via [this link](https://Ansh2209.github.io/odin-recipes "Visit the website!")
